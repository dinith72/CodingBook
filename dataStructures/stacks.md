## Intro

stacks follows the general **Last in First out (LIFO)** concept . 
morre information about stacks - [more info](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-stack-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/)

stacks has 2 key methods 
 - **push** - add to stack 
 - **pop** - remove from the stack

## stacks through linked list 

stacks can be implmented through a linked list easily .

> for *push* - item is added at the begining of the node 

> for *pop* - item is removed from the begining of the node. 

code implmentation is shown [here](https://gist.github.com/dinith95/59a20b06e86450859982227a56b9beb7)
